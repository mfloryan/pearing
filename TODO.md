How many free lives should we allocate?
How often do people return to answer a question?
Do we need a UI for this or could we play the entire game through other people's front ends?
How long will people play for?
How many players do we need to make the game attractive to other players?
Would players play the game every day of the week - current assumption is that we should only set the game running during the weekdays.

Game needs to be secure - regulated industry.
Game is massively susceptible to bots. How do we deal with those?

Create Polls.

Create a Game.

A Game runs 5 days a week.

A Game has multiple Polls only one of which is active at any one time.

I can define a monetary Prize (a Prize can be zero to start with. The Prize may change through the game as more Players enter or buy lives) for the Game.

A Player can sign up to play the Game.

During sign up we age check Players.

At point of Purchase or Prize Delivery we conduct 

A Player will be allocated a number of Lives.

There are two different types of Life. Lives that save you when you've done something wrong. Lives that allow you to skip something.

As a Player I can earn additional Lives

A Player should have a OneMoreQuestion account though they should be able to log in with Twitter, Facebook, Phone Number (in the case of SMS), Email, Username etc.

A Question can be defined. Each question has a defined set of answers.

A Question exists for a scheduled amount of time.

A Player can decide how to be notified of new questions. They may select multiple channels.

A Player can answer a Question.

A Player gets immediate feedback when they Answer a Question.

A Player can receive the results of the Poll at a scheduled time.

A Player can earn additional Lives by answering a defined number of questions correctly consecutively (with no omissions (skipping)).

A Player Loses a Life when they are in the minority of a Poll.

When there is a split vote in a Poll none of the Players that participated lose a Life.

A Player can earn additional Lives by Inviting new Players to the Game.

A Player can Buy additional Lives.

A Game transitions between States. There are 3 States: beginning, middle and end.

Transitions between Game States are based on some difficult maths stuff that hasn't been worked out yet.

In the End State no new Players can join the game

No new Lives can be earned in the End State

Final Questions of a Game are not Poll based questions.
