Create Polls.

Create a Game.

A Game has multiple Polls only one of which is active at any one time.

I can define a monetary Prize (a Prize can be zero to start with. The Prize may change through the game as more Players enter or buy lives) for the Game.

A Player can sign up to play the Game.

During sign up we age check Players.

At point of Purchase or Prize Delivery we conduct 

A Player will be allocated a number of Lives.

A Player should have a OneMoreQuestion account though they should be able to log in with Twitter, Facebook, Phone Number (in the case of SMS), Email, Username etc.

A Question can be defined. Each question has a defined set of answers.

A Game transitions between States. There are 3 States: beginning, middle and end.

Final Questions of a Game are not Poll based questions.
